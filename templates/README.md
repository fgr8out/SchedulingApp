## ServePrep

ServePrep is a dynamic scheduling system that minimizes conflict. It makes managing changes toÂ timetables and sharing rooms easy. It is a distributed system that allows multiple schedule managers to coordinate efforts to build and modify a schedule that meets diverse organizational needs. Intended as an internal solution for a federal agency, this application analyzes data from archived dataset to expedite scheduling for large groups.

## Getting Started

1. Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

        $ gem install rails

2. At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:

        $ rails new myapp

   where "myapp" is the application name.

3. Change directory to `myapp` and start the web server:

        $ cd myapp
        $ rails server

   Run with `--help` or `-h` for options.

4. Using a browser, go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see:
"Welcome aboard: You're riding Ruby on Rails!"

5. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application. You may find
